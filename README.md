# Sora Font Project

The Sora types were commissioned as a custom solution for branding and interface design.
Sora works with blockchain technologies in diverse financial contexts and the typeface had to manifest, without any doubt, ideals of technology and engineering which are at the core of their business.

The outcome is a type family with cues of low-resolution aesthetics and early screen typography but without nostalgia, as every decision was considered towards the crisp digital environment of today.

The particularly big x-height combined with evidently generous counters turns the family into a convenient tool for app and web interfaces, where clarity and effectiveness at any size is an imperative.
